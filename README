CaveSave
==================
This utility transfers Cave Story (a k a Doukutsu Monogatari) save files
between the Windows and MacOS versions. A utility is needed for this,
because the Windows version saves into a file called "Profile.dat",
while the Mac version embeds this file into its preferences plist file.

This utility doesn't actually work yet. Cave Story crashes when trying
to load a transferred save file. I'm working on this...
